- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @analuizatenorio
Iâ€™m a math PhD student and I'm tring to discover if git is useful for me and how to use it.
My PhD is about a generalization of the notion of sheaves and a correspont cohomology theory for it.
I'm also interested in how to describe all mathematics using category theory and undertand aplications of category theory in natural language processing.
